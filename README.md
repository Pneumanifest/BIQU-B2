# BIQU-B2

## Use at your own risk I have only tested it on my own printer

This is currently the firmware I use for the BIQU B1 with the B2 (2 in 1 hotend) with an SKR2 Board (f407 chip) and TMC2225(2208) drivers and NO BLtouch. Driver jumpers need to be placed in UART mode. 
[Reference image for UART mode.](https://github.com/Apexpredation/BIQU-B2/blob/9b9021f619ca5781a41008cb943e74a28306bcdb/Reference%20Images/SKR2%20UART%20Mode.jpg)


## NOTE: See the other branches for the SKR1.4 version with and without BLTouch.
